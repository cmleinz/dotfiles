# dotfiles

These are just my personal dotfiles, I apologize I know that not all the authors are properly attributed, this is a collection of tweaked dot files and I don't fully recall the source of all of them. At some later date I fully intend to clean them up.

## Required programs

```bash
mpd, sway, swaybg, swayidle, ncmpcpp
```
