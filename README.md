# dotfiles

These are just my personal dotfiles, I apologize I know that not all the authors are properly attributed, this is a collection of tweaked dot files and I don't fully recall the source of all of them. At some later date I fully intend to clean them up.

## Required programs

```
emacs, git, flatpak, rust, exa, i3-gaps, rofi, zathura, dunst, polybar, alacritty, fish, textlive,
```
